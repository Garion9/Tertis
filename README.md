# Tertis
## About the project
This project is a recreation of and homage to an all time classic - Tetris.<br>
It was written entirely in C++ and using SFML library.

## How to play
The controls are described in game.
Since it is a simple recreation of Tetris, the gameplay is also very reminiscent of it - place tetrominos to fill up rows, by filling up rows get points and increase combo counter to get even more points.
The more lines you clear at once the more points you get. Try to last as long as possible and get as many points as you can.

## Setup
The project requires having installed and properly linked the SFML library.<br>
The official site to download it is here: <br>https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/<br>
As for what to do next, it depends on your system.<br>
I personally worked on the project on Windows in Visual Studio.
Official guide on how to setup SFML in Visual Studio is here: <br>https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php<br>
Also note that the project was built using dynamic versions of SFML libraries with Solution Configuration and Solution Platform set to "Release" and "x86" respectively in Visual Studio.
